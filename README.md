# Hapster
Assembles 2-chromosome haplotypes from short read sequencing data (See data generated by datagen for formatting input). This program employs a fairly simple algorithm since it assumes no sequencing errors and that every position has been sequenced with at least length 2. As a result, this algorithm performs in linear time with exactly N assignments using only the first 2-length read at each position, where N is the number of SNPs. After assembling the haplotype, Hapster will offer to check the output with the true haplotype sequences, if available.

# Hapache
Assembles 2-chromosome haplotypes from short read sequecning data allowing for sequencing errors! This program employs a scoring based system that counts the number of possible 2mers from reads at each position and assembles the haplotypes using the most frequent possibility. As a result, this algorithm performs in linear time with on the order of 2\*k\*N operations, where k is the number of times a position is sequenced and N is the total number of SNPs. A fundamental assmuption is that the correct haplotype is sequenced the most frequently. The program interface is identical to Hapster.

# Datagen

datagen produces 2 complementary haplotype sequences of a given length as well as simulated sequencing data for this haplotype. 

Instructions for use:

1. Run as "python datagen.py output" in terminal

  -"output" = name of output file for generated data (.txt will be concatenated automatically). If no argument passed, default will be "output".

2. The program will prompt the user to enter the number of SNPs and error rate (between 0 and 1). 

3. When completed, "output.txt" will contain the sequencing data and "output_haplotypes.txt" will contain the haplotype sequences. 

Number of reads per SNP is normally distributed with mean of 10, standard dev of 2, and minimum of 7. Length of each read is normally distributed with mean of 5, standard dev of 0.05, and minimum of 5. These values are somewhat arbitrary and can be changed within datagen.py. However, at least 1 read of length 2 at each position is required for Hapster to successfully assemble the haplotype. 

# Misc

errortest.py approximates the sequencing error rate from a read matrix given the correct haplotypes. For test purposes. 

# TODO

1. Determine the error rate threshold for hapache

2. Compare hapache to some baseline. Considering HASH (Bansal et al., 2008) or HapCut (Bansal and Bafna, 2008).

3. Write a haplotype assembler for multiple chromosomes and associated data generator
